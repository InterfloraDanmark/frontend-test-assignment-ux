# 💐 Interflora UI/UX & Accessibility assignment

> Build a small web application showcasing your knowledge of UI/UX and accessibility
>

At Interflora we respect that people have different skill levels. You should not look at this assignment as a test that will determine if you get hired or not.

The goal of this assignment is to determine your skill level and to serve as a starting point for a conversation about your knowledge of UI/UX and accessibility as well as a way for you to showcase what you think needs to be put forward for the best user experience.

## 🧙‍♂ Requirements️
Your app must conform to these requirements

* **Must include a login/signup view**
* **Must include a user profile view**
* **Must NOT use any css framework**
* **Must be available on GitHub**

## 🔮 Project guidelines

Build a simple web application that will first take us to a signup/login view and then to a user profile or business profile page.

Please choose an industry or a sector for your project. For example you could choose that you want to build this web application in the context of a yoga studio, a flower entusiasts' website or anything else that you prefer. The goal here is to be able to discuss about how this influenced the choices that you made from a user experience perspective while creating this project.

As this is a UI/UX and accessibility assignment, none of the views or components should be connected to a backend.

### 🌙 Responsiveness

Making sure that all the components and views created in this project are fully responvive will be a big plus

### ✨ Accessibility

The more accessible this app is, the better!

### 🎭 HTML/CSS

We would like to see modern standards and good practices in your HTML and CSS code
